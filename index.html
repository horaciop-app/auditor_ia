This file contains the HTML and CSS for the Intiza Cobranzas webpage. The code defines the structure and styling of the page, 
including a hero banner, various sections, and a popup form.

The popup form styling is controlled by the CSS within the <style> tags. To move the close button of the popup form more to the left, 
you would need to modify the CSS rules targeting the close button within the dialog.popup_form.

Looking at the code, the close button seems to be styled with the following rules:

css

dialog.popup_form button {
  opacity: .6;
  position: absolute;
  right: .5rem; /* This controls the horizontal position from the right */
  top: .5rem;
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
  padding: .4rem;
}
Use code snippets with caution

And for mobile:

css

@media (max-width: 767px) {
  /* BOTÓN CERRAR MÓVIL - CORREGIDO */
  dialog.popup_form button#cancel_button {
    position: fixed !important;
    top: 0.5rem !important;
    right: 0.5rem !important; /* This controls the horizontal position from the right for mobile */
    /* ... other styles ... */
  }
}

Use code snippets with caution

To move the button to the left, you have a few options:

Adjust the right property: Increase the value of right (e.g., change .5rem to 1rem or 2rem). This will push the button further away 
from the right edge, effectively moving it left.
Use the left property instead: Remove the right property and add a left property with a value that positions the button from the left
edge of its containing element (the dialog). For example, left: .5rem;.
To move the button more to the left, you should decrease the right value or use the left property.

For example, to move the button further to the left for both desktop and mobile, you could modify the CSS like this:

css

dialog.popup_form button {
  opacity: .6;
  position: absolute;
  /* Change right to a larger value, or use left */
  right: 2rem; /* Example: Increased right value */
  /* or */
  /* left: .5rem; */ /* Example: Using left instead of right */
  top: .5rem;
  display: grid;
  place-content: center;
  padding: .4rem;
}

@media (max-width: 767px) {
  /* BOTÓN CERRAR MÓVIL - CORREGIDO */
  dialog.popup_form button#cancel_button {
    position: fixed !important;
    top: 0.5rem !important;
    /* Change right to a larger value, or use left */
    right: 2rem !important; /* Example: Increased right value for mobile */
    /* or */
    /* left: .5rem !important; */ /* Example: Using left instead of right for mobile */
    opacity: 1 !important;
    font-size: 1rem !important;
    font-weight: bold !important;
    padding: 0.5rem !important;
    z-index: 1001 !important;
    width: 40px !important;
    height: 40px !important;
    border-radius: 0.25rem !important;

    display: flex !important;
    align-items: center !important;
    justify-content: center !important;
    margin: 0 !important;
    border: 2px solid white !important;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3) !important;
  }
}

Remember to save the changes and refresh the page to see the effect. You might need to experiment with the values to get the desired positioning.
